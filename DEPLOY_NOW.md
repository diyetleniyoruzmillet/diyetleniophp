# ðŸš€ Production Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy (All Steps in One Command)

### SSH into your production server first:
```bash
ssh monster@diyetlenio.com
cd /home/monster/diyetlenio
```

### Then run ONE of these commands:

#### Option 1: Using MySQL CLI (Recommended)
```bash
mysql -u root -p diyetlenio_db < scripts/complete-setup.sql
```

#### Option 2: Using sudo
```bash
sudo mysql diyetlenio_db < scripts/complete-setup.sql
```

#### Option 3: Web-based (via phpMyAdmin)
1. Login to phpMyAdmin
2. Select `diyetlenio_db` database
3. Go to SQL tab
4. Copy and paste contents of `scripts/complete-setup.sql`
5. Click "Go"

---

## What This Will Do:

âœ… Create `client_profiles` table (for client personal information)
âœ… Create `weight_tracking` table (for weight measurements)
âœ… Capitalize all user names (Mehmet YÄ±lmaz, not mehmet yÄ±lmaz)
âœ… Verify everything was created successfully

---

## Verification

After running the setup, verify with:

```bash
mysql -u root -p diyetlenio_db
```

Then run:
```sql
-- Check tables exist
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'client_profiles';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'weight_tracking';

-- Check table structures
DESCRIBE client_profiles;
DESCRIBE weight_tracking;

-- Check some user names (should be capitalized)
SELECT full_name FROM users LIMIT 10;
```

---

## Test the Features

1. **Client Profile Page:**
   - Login as a client
   - Go to: https://www.diyetlenio.com/client/profile.php
   - You should see profile form with personal info fields

2. **Weight Tracking Page:**
   - Login as a client
   - Go to: https://www.diyetlenio.com/client/weight-tracking.php
   - You should see weight tracking interface

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Table already exists" error
This is normal and safe - it means the table was already created.

### "Access denied" error
Try with sudo:
```bash
sudo mysql diyetlenio_db < scripts/complete-setup.sql
```

### Want to see changes before applying?
Add `--verbose` to see what's happening:
```bash
mysql -u root -p diyetlenio_db --verbose < scripts/complete-setup.sql
```

---

## Safety Notes

âœ… Safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS)
âœ… Only updates names that need fixing
âœ… No data will be deleted
âœ… No existing tables will be modified (only adds new ones)

---

## Need Help?

If you encounter any errors:
1. Copy the error message
2. Check `/var/log/mysql/error.log`
3. Verify database name with: `grep DB_DATABASE .env`

---

**Ready to deploy? Run this single command:**

```bash
mysql -u root -p diyetlenio_db < scripts/complete-setup.sql
```

**Enter your MySQL root password when prompted, and you're done!** ðŸŽ‰

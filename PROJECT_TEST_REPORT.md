## Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 🔴 Issue #1: CSRF Vulnerability in admin/reviews.php
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Description:**
Delete functionality lacked CSRF protection, allowing potential Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

**Location:** `public/admin/reviews.php:121-127`

**Before:**
```php
<button onclick="deleteReview(<?= $review['id'] ?>)" class="btn btn-sm btn-danger">
    <i class="fas fa-trash"></i>
</button>
```

**After:**
```php
<form method="POST" class="d-inline" onsubmit="return confirm('Bu değerlendirmeyi silmek istediğinizden emin misiniz?')">
    <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="<?= getCsrfToken() ?>">
    <input type="hidden" name="delete_id" value="<?= $review['id'] ?>">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-sm btn-danger" title="Sil">
        <i class="fas fa-trash"></i>
    </button>
</form>
```

**Added POST Handler:**
```php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && isset($_POST['delete_id'])) {
    if (!verifyCsrfToken($_POST['csrf_token'] ?? '')) {
        setFlash('error', 'Geçersiz form gönderimi.');
    } else {
        $deleteId = (int)$_POST['delete_id'];
        $stmt = $conn->prepare("DELETE FROM reviews WHERE id = ?");
        $stmt->execute([$deleteId]);
        setFlash('success', 'Değerlendirme başarıyla silindi.');
    }
    redirect('/admin/reviews.php');
}
```

### 🟡 Issue #2: Database Connection Pattern in admin/clients.php
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Description:**
Inconsistent database connection usage and wrong field names (first_name/last_name instead of full_name).

**Location:** `public/admin/clients.php:13, 67`

**Fixed:**
1. Database connection pattern updated to match other admin files
2. Changed `first_name . ' ' . last_name` to `full_name`
3. Added filter to exclude deleted users: `WHERE u.email NOT LIKE 'deleted_%'`

**Before:**
```php
<td><?= clean($client['first_name'] . ' ' . $client['last_name']) ?></td>
```

**After:**
```php
<td><?= clean($client['full_name']) ?></td>
```

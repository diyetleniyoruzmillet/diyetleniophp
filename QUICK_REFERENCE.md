## 5 CRITICAL BLOCKERS PREVENTING PRODUCTION

### 1. Payment System (20% complete)
- **Issue:** Only manual receipt upload, no online payment gateway
- **Impact:** Can't process payments, can't launch business

### 3. Security Issues (50% complete)
- **Issues:**
  - XSS protection not applied consistently (~150 locations)
  - CSRF tokens missing on some forms
  - `.env` file exposed in git with credentials
- **Impact:** Data breach risk
- **Time to fix:** 4-6 hours
- **Action:** Immediately rotate exposed credentials

### 4. Email Notifications (60% complete)
- **Issue:** Mail class exists but not integrated with features
- **Impact:** Users don't get appointment reminders, confirmations

## SECURITY CREDENTIALS EXPOSED

### CRITICAL: Remove from git immediately!
**File:** `/home/monster/diyetlenio/.env`

**Exposed:**
```
DB_PASSWORD=HrpWATAjzmJhHeUuUWuItKmmwvtVXGZf
MAIL_PASSWORD=diyetlenio2025_smtp_password
```

**Actions:**
1. Change all passwords immediately
2. Remove `.env` from git history (use BFG tool)
3. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
4. Regenerate APP_KEY

## KEY FILE LOCATIONS

### Core Files
- **Main config:** `/config/config.php`
- **Database:** `/classes/Database.php`
- **Auth:** `/classes/Auth.php`
- **Helpers:** `/includes/functions.php`
- **Bootstrap:** `/includes/bootstrap.php`

### Public Panels
- **Client:** `/public/client/`
- **Dietitian:** `/public/dietitian/`
- **Admin:** `/public/admin/`

### Critical Missing Code
- **Payment Processing:** Needs to be built in `/public/client/`
